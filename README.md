## Abstract
This paper presents a unified hypothesis of cyclic energetic eruptions of black holes, combining a model of gravity emergence from five-dimensional spacetime with a mechanism of controlled matter-antimatter conversion. We propose that when the density inside a black hole exceeds a critical value (ρ > ρₗₒ𝒸ᶜʳ ~ 10¹⁸ kg/m³), spontaneous but stable conversion of matter (M) to antimatter (A) occurs, leading to cyclic energy release through temporary event horizon loss.

## Key Features
- Explains absence of singularities in black holes
- Provides mechanism for cosmic mega-explosions (e.g., AT2021lwx)
- Solves baryon number conservation problem
- Predicts unique observational signatures:
  - Broad asymmetric annihilation profile (0-511 keV)
  - Specific periodicity-eruption relationship (T ∼ M/Ṁ)
