# Hypothesis-of-Cyclic-Black-Hole-Eruptions-in-Higher-Dimensional-Geometry
Unified Cyclic Black Hole Eruption Hypothesis: Proposes that extreme densities trigger matter-antimatter conversion, powering cosmic explosions via temporary event horizon loss. Emergent gravity arises from 5D spacetime tension between matter/antimatter branes. Predicts unique gamma-ray profiles and eruption cyclicity (T ∼ M/Ṁ).
